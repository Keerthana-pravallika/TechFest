Catering the unemployment in covid 19 scenario

                                                            Abstract

Currently due to covid 19 pandemic, many of the people have lost their jobs and their major source of income has been affected. So, we have come with an idea where we built a website which helps  people to search technical, non technical internships and jobs, based on their skill set they could also get recommendations for jobs and we also include hackathons, coding competitions which aim for hiring people. 

Our website includes 
-> Home / About us

-> Hackathons

-> Technical internships

-> Non Technical internships

-> Jobs

-> Recommendation

-> Contact us

-> Login / Sign up

Hackathons page includes different coding competitions like Codevita etc.. which helps students to participate and get internships in respective companies. Technical internship page include different roles in different companies like SDE, Data science intern, developer intern etc… . Non technical internship page include different roles like social media marketing intern , HR, content writer etc… . Jobs page include full time and part time opportunities in various companies. Recommendation page includes a form where a particular person will fill the details like skills , education background etc… based on which they will get recommendation to particular jobs.
